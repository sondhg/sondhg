# What I'm working on

A web app to control a vehicle

- [agv-project](https://github.com/sondhg/agv-project): frontend (Currently developing on branch "tailwind". You should clone that branch instead of "master")
- [my-django-server](https://github.com/sondhg/my-django-server): backend (For now, this is just a server only for login, register and logout API actions. It doesn't have as many functionalities as Hoang Anh's server.)
